# VIPUI

Get Started
-----------
To get started using VIPUI, you just need two part, the CSS part and the JavaScript part.

You can include the VIPUI CSS file in your project :

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://yoursite.com/vipui/dist/css/vipui.css">
```

You can include the VIPUI JavaScript file in your project :

```html
<src type="text/javascript" href="https://yoursite.com/vipui/dist/js/vipui.js"></script>
```

Browser Support and Testing
---------------------------

VIPUI is tested and works in:

* IE 8+
* Latest Stable: Firefox, Chrome, Safari
* iOS 6-8
* Android 4.x

And maybe it worked in other browsers too 
(but we did not really test it on them, maybe you can test that by yourself:laughing:)
